  <h3>profile<h3>

  <p>As a former advertising account supervisor, I’ve cultivated a reputation for
    being extremely calm in the face of chaos. During my time in advertising, I
    learned the ins and outs of client service and what makes great advertising
    and design great! Through that, I learned that I didn’t want to stand idly by
    while others got to create! I wanted to get my hands dirty with code.</p>
