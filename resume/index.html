profile

As a former advertising account supervisor, I’ve cultivated a reputation for being extremely calm in the face of chaos. During my time in advertising, I learned the ins and outs of client service and what makes great advertising and design great! Through that, I learned that I didn’t want to stand idly by while others got to create! I wanted to get my hands dirty with code.
