    <h2>profile</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As a former advertising account supervisor, I’ve cultivated a reputation for
        being extremely calm in the face of chaos. During my time in advertising, I
        learned the ins and outs of client service and what makes great advertising
        and design great! Through that, I learned that I didn’t want to stand idly by
        while others got to create! I wanted to get my hands dirty with code.
