  <h1>hello. it's nice to meet you.</h1>
  <p>In December 2015 I quit my full-time gig as an Account Supervisor at a
    Toronto ad agency to pursue a career as a full-stack web developer.
    In March 2016 I graduated from Bitmaker's full-time web development project.
    Now I am a full-time web developer.</p>
