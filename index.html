    <p>I'm <span class="pink">Ann Marie</span>, or <span class="pink">Am</span>
      for short. I am a web developer, coffee lover, book nerd,
      and a sometimes adventurer. I'm a former advertising account supervisor
      who has cultivated a reputation for being calm in the face of chaos.
      Advertising has taught me the ins and outs of client service and what
      makes advertising and design great. Through that, I have learned that I
      do not want to stand idly by while others get to create.
      I want to get my hands dirty with code.</p>
