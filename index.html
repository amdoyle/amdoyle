    <p>
      I'm <span class="pink">Ann Marie</span>, or <span class="pink">Am</span> for short. I am a web developer, coffee lover, book nerd, yogi, knitter and sometimes an adventurer. I'm a former advertising account supervisor who has cultivated a reputation for being calm in the face of chaos. Advertising taught me the ins and outs of client service and what makes advertising and design great.
      Through that, I have learned that I donâ€™t want to stand idly by while others get to create. I want to get my hands dirty with code.

      Now, as a web developer, I get to combine my love of design, passion for creating and building, and my endless pursuit of learning in my work.
