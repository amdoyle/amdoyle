          I'm <span class="pink">Ann Marie</span>, or <span class="pink">Am</span> for short. I am a front-end developer, coffee lover, book nerd, yogi, knitter, and sometimes an adventurer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently focused on learning new things and updating my site to reflect all great things Iâ€™m learning.
