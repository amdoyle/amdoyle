    <p>I'm <span class="pink">Ann Marie</span>, or <span class="pink">Am</span> for short. I am a web developer, coffee lover, book nerd,
      and sometimes an adventure. I'm former advertising account supervisor, who's has a
       reputation for being extremely calm in the face of chaos. During my time in
       advertising, I learned the ins and outs of client service and what makes
       great advertising and design great! Through that, I learned that I didnâ€™t
       want to stand idly by while others got to create! I wanted to get my
       hands dirty with code.</p>
